# Mapping-Earthquakes

## Overview of Earthquakes with JS & APIs 

The purpose of this project was to help Basil and Sadhana ad on to the earthquake map and add additional dimension to it, specifically highlighting the locations of the earths tectonic plates, as well as ploting out all earhtquakes that were greater than 4.5 in magnitude. Using Leaflet and JavaScript we were able to write code that generated an a additional layer for the tectonic plates and major earthquakes.
